# Instructions for reproducing results related to Figure. 2

### This directory contains the code to reproduce all figures from the DeepRVAT association testing on the 470k UKBB cohort using REGENIE.


The DeepRVAT model used to compute DeepRVAT gene impairment scores for all analyses in Figure 4 is the one trained in `deeprvat_main_exp`. 
Follow the instructions from the main DeepRVAT instructions for using [DeepRVAT with REGENIE](https://deeprvat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deeprvat.html#running-the-association-testing-pipeline-with-regenie) with precomputed gene impairment scores for quantiative and binary traits and on diverse subsets of samples. 
For running the default REGENIE RVAT test (burden/SKAT) see the [REGENIE documentation](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/).
